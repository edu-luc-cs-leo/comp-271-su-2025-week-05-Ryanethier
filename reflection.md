# Week 04 Reflection

During Week 04, I missed submitting the assignment, which I recognize was a misstep in my engagement with the course. While it was not intentional, it reminded me how important consistency and time management are in a course that is strictly online.

Missing the assignment made me realize that even small lapses can have a big impact on my success and understanding of the material. Since then, I’ve adjusted my workflow a bit to check assignment deadlines more frequently and added personal reminders to stay ahead of schedule.

I’m learning that growth in this course isn’t just about writing code, it’s about building reliable habits. I plan to carry this lesson forward to avoid repeating the same mistake in future weeks.
